# Hello!
This script automates a unique GroupBy business process. It includes the ability to
* load data of a specific format
* connect to a database to map IDs
* convert to JSON
* download final file

## Getting Started
You must have R or R studio installed on your computer. The app is contained in two files, the interface part (ui.R) and the operational part (server.R).

No input file is needed to launch the app, but for the algorithm to run properly, the input file needs to be structured as is detailed in the "Instructions" portion.

## Shiny Resources
Thanks to all the open source code out there that helped me in creating this! These apps are largely what I based this one on:
* [Shiny App - Twin Cities Buses](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/bus-dashboard.html)
* [Shiny App - Image Output](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/image-output.html)
